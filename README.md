# Aframe Go ðŸš€

This is my StarterKit for Aframe. There are many like it but this one is mine.

My StarterKit is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.

---

I created this using the things I used all the time for building prototypes and fleshing out ideas when working with Aframe. Its goals are simple. I want to go from idea to deploy as quick as possible and use all the things that I like to use. This isn't supposed to be prescriptive or 'The RIGHT way', just A way, a way that I like. 

I want to use Pug  ( because I like it )

I want to use Scss ( because I like it )

I want to write ES6 ( samesies )

I want to deploy to surge ( it's pretty quick and cool )
